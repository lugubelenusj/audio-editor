This program takes in audio files (.wav) and represents the sound data using a multi-channel linked list. Each channel represents a different output that the sound is coming from (for example earphones have 2 channels). Each node of the linked list contains a data value that represents its sound relative to other nodes, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the next channel.

The program also supports the ability to add an echo, reverse the list of samples, change the speed, add more another sound sample to the current one, splice in a sample, combine two samples, combine all channels into one, create a fade in and a fade out effect, trim silence, and make a clone (deep copy) of the sample.
